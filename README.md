# My Implementation of an 8-Bit Computer on Breadboard
This design is largely inspired by Ben Eater's design, with upgrades like a 256-byte directly addressable (and 256 more stack-accessible) RAM, a functional LCD display, etc. 

The `8-bit Instructions.pdf` file contains a list of currently-implemented instructions. Unfortunately, I can only work on the project intermittently during breaks.

More design details will be shared as soon as I draw up schematics.
